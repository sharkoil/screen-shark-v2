# Screen Shark Chrome Extension - Phase 1 Project Scope

## Project Overview
Build a production-ready Chrome extension called "Screen Shark" that captures annotated screenshots with visual overlays during user interactions and records comprehensive session data, generating downloadable TXT files with complete session metadata when sessions end.

## Phase 1 Core Requirements âœ… COMPLETED

### 1. Screenshot Capture System âœ…
- **Manual Screenshot Capture**: On-demand screenshot capture via popup button
- **Automatic Interaction Capture**: Screenshots triggered by user interactions (clicks, form submissions)
- **Visual Overlay Annotations**: Orange highlighted borders around clicked elements with descriptive labels
- **Element Information Display**: Smart labels showing element type, name/ID, text content, and alt text
- **Organized File Storage**: Screenshots saved to `Downloads/Screen Shark/[domain]/` with sequential naming
- **Element Context Recording**: Capture clicked element details (tagName, text, id, position, attributes)
- **Tab Context Awareness**: Handle multi-tab scenarios with proper tab identification

### 2. Visual Overlay System âœ… 
- **Real-time Element Highlighting**: Orange borders with pulsing animation around clicked elements
- **Smart Element Detection**: Multiple methods for finding target elements (position, ID, properties, click coordinates)
- **Comprehensive Element Labels**: Format: `ðŸ“¸ BUTTON [submit-btn]: "Click me" (Submit button)`
- **Information Display**: Shows element type, name/ID, text content, alt text, and aria-label
- **Screenshot Integration**: Overlays visible in captured screenshots for documentation
- **Timing Optimization**: Proper render delays and visibility verification
- **Cross-page Compatibility**: Works on all accessible web pages

### 3. Session Recording & Management âœ…
- **Session State Management**: Start/stop recording sessions with persistent state
- **Session Data Structure**: Comprehensive session objects with metadata:
  - Session ID, domain, start/end timestamps
  - Screenshot sequence and file references with overlay information
  - Page navigation history and visit counts
  - User interaction details and complete element information
  - Browser viewport and extension version metadata
- **Session Persistence**: Maintain session state across tab navigation and browser restarts
- **Multi-tab Coordination**: Synchronize session state across all active tabs
- **Session Timeout**: Automatic cleanup after 5 minutes of inactivity

### 4. TXT File Generation & Download âœ…
- **Session TXT Export**: Generate complete session data as downloadable TXT files (JSON format)
- **Reliable File Downloads**: Use Chrome downloads API with base64 data URLs for robust saving
- **Organized Folder Structure**: Create domain-specific subfolders for file organization  
- **Error-Resistant Downloads**: Robust download handling with fallback to console logging
- **Download Verification**: Real-time validation that files are successfully saved
- **Session End Triggers**: Multiple ways to end sessions (manual save, force stop, timeout)

### 5. User Interface Components âœ…
- **Extension Popup**: Clean, intuitive interface with session controls and status display
- **Status Indicators**: Visual feedback for recording state and session status
- **Debug Mode**: Advanced testing and troubleshooting interface with test buttons
- **Floating Action Button**: In-page recording indicator with session controls (content script)
- **Session Controls**: Start/stop recording, manual capture, force stop, overlay testing
- **Notification System**: Success/error notifications for all major actions

### 6. Advanced Features âœ…
- **Debug Mode**: Comprehensive logging, test buttons, JSON generation testing, overlay validation
- **Session Timeout**: Automatic session cleanup after inactivity periods
- **Force Stop Functionality**: Emergency session termination across all tabs with notification
- **Permission Management**: Proper Chrome API permissions including scripting for overlays
- **Extension Icon Updates**: Dynamic icon changes to reflect recording state
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of tab access restrictions and permission issues

### 7. Testing & Validation Infrastructure âœ…
- **Automated Test Suite**: Comprehensive Node.js tests for logic validation (17 tests across 4 suites)
- **Code Structure Tests**: Verify all required methods and components exist
- **Scenario Testing**: Validate session end scenarios and edge cases
- **Download Validation**: Real Chrome downloads API testing with file verification
- **Error Handling Tests**: Robust error scenarios and recovery mechanisms
- **Overlay Testing**: Specialized tests for overlay creation, visibility, and screenshot integration
- **Critical Issue Resolution**: Complete debugging and fixing of overlay functionality
- **Download Validation**: Real Chrome downloads API testing with file verification
- **Error Handling Tests**: Robust error scenarios and recovery mechanisms

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Components
- **`background.js`**: Service worker handling screenshots, session management, downloads
- **`content.js`**: Content script for interaction detection and UI injection
- **`popup.html/js`**: Extension popup interface and controls
- **`manifest.json`**: Chrome extension configuration with required permissions

### Key Permissions Required âœ…
- `activeTab`: Screenshot capture of current tab
- `storage`: Session state persistence  
- `downloads`: TXT file downloads to user's folder
- `notifications`: User feedback and status updates
- `scripting`: Overlay injection and interaction detection for visual annotations
- `<all_urls>`: Content script injection across all sites

### Data Flow âœ…
1. **Session Start**: Initialize session object, update storage, notify all tabs
2. **Interaction Detection**: Content script detects clicks, sends element data to background
3. **Overlay Creation**: Background script injects visual overlay with element highlighting and labels
4. **Screenshot Capture**: Background script captures tab screenshots with overlays via Chrome API
5. **Data Recording**: Store interaction details, element info, overlay data, and file references
6. **Session End**: Generate complete TXT file (JSON format), download via Chrome downloads API
7. **Cleanup**: Clear session state, notify tabs, update extension icon
